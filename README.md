# Organization 
1. Code includes the code required to produce the analytical datasets to produce both figures. 
2. Data - includes the source **csv** files used in the code.
   -You will need to change the dates to the following format YYYY-MM-DD if they are not in that format. 
   
# Use
* Feel free to create a new branch for further incorporation and analysis.
* Please cite if you use of the code or data (Can you spare a cite?). 

# Data
I produced this datasets with the information available in newspapers and the website of the [Senate of Puerto Rico](https://senado.pr.gov/). Some dates may be wrong! Below, I indicate how you can tell me to change this. 

# Codebook
This is a long form dataset. 

Education - is a categorical variable indicating whether the respondent had a:
* Bachelor
* Masters
* Juris Doctor
* PhD

Name - the full name of the appointee

Initials - are the initials of each appointee. If a person has been appointed twice they have a number next to their initial. 

Date - for the first 30 entries the dataset has the date of appointment, for the second batch of entries (also 30) Date is the date when the person left the position

Gov_Officer - a dichotomous variable indicating whether the respondent was a Government Representative or not. 

Date Appointed - A variable that includes the date of appointment in both entries. 

Rank - The number/order of appointments. It has a similar structure as Date. 

This information is up to date as of 12/24/2018.
